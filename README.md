# 🌀 Absurdism Shake

A surreal, playful website inspired by Absurdist literature.

📱 Shake your phone and watch meaningful sentences dissolve into poetic chaos — then **drag the words back** into place to restore order (or invent your own).

---

## ✨ Features

- 📜 Displays a full coherent sentence at first
- 📱 Uses your phone's motion sensor (or a button fallback) to scramble the words
- 🎯 Drag-and-drop to reassemble the original sentence
- 🎭 A creative blend of interaction and philosophy

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the website on a **mobile device** for the best experience
2. Shake your phone — the words will scatter
3. **Drag** the words around to restore the original sentence (or create your own meaning)

## 💡 Inspiration

This project is inspired by **Absurdism** — a philosophy that explores the conflict between humans' search for meaning and a meaningless universe.  
This interactive page lets users experience that conflict, then try to impose their own order.
